# Geo::Index

Geo::Index is a Perl module that allows the creation of in-memory geographic 
indices of sets of points.  Once an index has been created one can run fast 
searches against the index.  The module supports search by distance, by 
bounding box and by proximity.

While by default computations are done for the Earth, other bodies can be 
used by supplying appropriates radii and circumferences.
